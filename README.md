# FundingProject
The "Funder" is a full-stack decentralized application (dApp) that includes a smart contract and a frontend interface. The dApp allows multiple funders to transfer and withdraw funds. It utilizes a mapping to track the number of funders and their addresses within the smart contract. Through the frontend interface, funders can interact with the contract by transferring funds using the `transfer` function and withdrawing a specified amount of Ether using the `withdraw` function, with a limit of 2 Ether per withdrawal. This dApp provides a user-friendly way for funders to contribute and manage their funds securely on the blockchain.
